Bookshop Management System (C++)

This is a college project so do not expect anything more from it. But any new additions will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

This program is a command-line version of Bookshop Management System that we see in the book stalls these days. Given program is a simple approach to create a data handling system of the Books and we have tried to use most of the operations/features of the Object Oriented Programming in C++.

It uses features like:
1) Operator Overloading
2) Function Overloading
3) Friend Functions
4) Virtual Functions
5) File handling (fstream)
6) Class Template
